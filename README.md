# Conecte-se - Back-End Course Project

This repository contains a project developed as part of a back-end course using TypeScript. The project focuses on creating a website related to tourist spots in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The course aimed to provide valuable skills and opportunities for young individuals from low-income backgrounds.

## Course Overview

The Conecte-se project was developed as part of a back-end course, focusing on TypeScript programming language. Throughout the course, students learned essential back-end development concepts and techniques, and applied their knowledge to create a website showcasing tourist spots in Rio de Janeiro.

## Features

- **TypeScript Programming**: Learn the fundamentals of TypeScript programming language.
- **Back-End Development**: Gain practical knowledge of back-end development concepts and techniques.
- **Web Development**: Develop a website showcasing tourist spots in Rio de Janeiro.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate a database to store and retrieve information about tourist spots.
- **API Development**: Build a RESTful API to interact with the website and retrieve data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Conecte-se project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: https://nodejs.org
- PostgreSQL or any other supported database system

## Getting Started

To get started with the Conecte-se project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/lucasmiko/conecte-se-back-end-rj01.git`
